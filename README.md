Authors: Angela Dai, Michael Jetsupphasuk, Abizer Lokhandwala, Harry Sutcliffe

## Description of project:
  Our objective in this project was to analyze the University of California compensation data from Transparent California. Our main research question: How has the University of California pay distribution changed over time?


## Organization of directories and files:
1. The code directory contains the code for cleaning, manipulating, and plotting the data. 
2. The rawdata directory contains all the raw data, i.e. the 2011-2014 datasets directly from Transparent California.
3. The data directory contains all the cleaned and separated datasets, e.g. the 2013 dataset seperated into academic and non-academic employees.
4. The resources directory contains three pdf files, one that was used for cleaning the data, another that was used to get enrollment data, and a third that was a paper about higher education spending and labor.
5. The report directory contains our report.
6. The images directory contains all the plots we created for our report.
