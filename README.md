## Description of project:
  Our objective in this project was to analyze the University of California compensation data from Transparent California. Our main research question: How has the University of California pay distribution changed over time?


## Organization of directories and files:
1. The code directory contains the code for cleaning, manipulating, and plotting the data. The rawdata directory contains all the raw data, i.e. the 2011-2014 datasets directly from Transparent California.
2. The data directory contains all the cleaned and separated datasets, e.g. the 2013 dataset seperated into academic and non-academic employees.
3. The resources directory contains two pdf files, one that was used for cleaning the data, and another that was used to get enrollment data.
4. The report directory contains our report.
5. The images directory contains all the plots we created for our report.
