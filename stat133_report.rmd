#Introduction
In 2014, the largest database of California government employee compensation was released: Transparent California. It is searchable by name and job titles on TransparentCalifornia.com, including more than 2 million salary records. In a time of budget cuts, we wanted to investigate the University of California employees. 

##Description of Problems 
Main Research Question: How has the University of California pay distribution changed over time? 

##Description of Data
Raw Data Sources: Transparent California (2012-2014), UCOP Academic Title Code, 
UC Student Enrollment

Potential Resource: http://www.air.org/sites/default/files/downloads/report/DeltaCostAIR-Labor-Expensive-Higher-Education-Staffing-Brief-Feb2014.pdf

Note: there are changes from year to year on classification of titles, spellings within years, etc. For our report, we are defining academic and staff as follows: Academic employees: those directly engaged in the academic mission â€“ professors, clinical professors, other teaching faculty, researchers, and other academic titles 
Staff/non-academic employees: those who support academic departments, student services, patient care and other university functions

#Analysis Approach

##Academic vs. Staff/Non-Academic Workforce Distribution of Total Compensation, 2012-2014
```{r}


```
This could be a bar chart showing changes in breakdown of academic vs staff/non-academic % compensation and changes in overall compensation, with: 
x-axis: $30k groupings of total compensation
y-axis: # of employees
We could conclude: 
The largest % of academic employees fall in the $x-$x range

##Average Total Compensation for Academic Positions, 2012-2014
```{r}


```
Conclude: the average pay of academic employees has been increasing/decreasing

##Workforce Headcount vs. Total Compensation Trends, 2012-2014
```{r}


```
Hypothesize that as headcount rises, compensation expected to rise. Is this tied to changes in student enrollment?

##Components of Total Compensation for Academic vs Staff
```{r}


```
Hypothesize more benefits for academic positions? E.g. they may have the same salary, but total compensation differs because of benefits.

##Student Services Compensation vs. UC Student Enrollment, 2012-2014
```{r}


```
Differences in % changes 
How many student services staff per 1,000 students
How much has student services compensation changed per 1,000 students

##Workforce Headcount vs. UC Student Enrollment, 2012-2014
```{r}


```
Hypothesize more headcount with more enrollment

##Workforce Compensation vs. UC Student Enrollment, 2012-2014
```{r}


```
Hypothesize more compensation with more enrollment. Since academic pay has decreased from 2013-2014,
how are costs being contained? See next graph

##Changes in % Lecturers vs % Tenured Professors 
```{r}


```
Are lecturers replacing full-time professors (or vice versa) in effort to contain costs? 

##Changes in Tuition vs Academic Spending
```{r}


```
It is often perceived that faculty spending is driving tuition increases. Is tuition increasing at the same rate as academic spending?
